This is a test of the local AI boardgame development process. The goal is to create a boardgame using boardgame.io and React. The process is as follows:

1. Read the rules of the game
2. Plan the development of the game
3. Implement the game
4. Test the game
5. Deploy the game

The plan is generated using a YAML configuration file and a PDF of the rules. The plan is then executed using a Python script.

The plan is stored in a Chromadb database and can be used to implement the game.
